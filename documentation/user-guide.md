3. **Server Issues**
   - Your server might be down or unreachable
   - Check server logs for error messages
   - Verify your server accepts POST requests

4. **CORS Issues**
   - Your server needs to allow requests from Chrome extensions
   - Check server CORS configuration

#### Context Menu Not Appearing
**Problem**: Right-click menu doesn't show clicPOST option.
**Solution**:
1. Check that the extension is installed and enabled
2. Try refreshing the webpage
3. Right-click in different areas of the page

#### Selected Text Not Being Captured
**Problem**: Text selection isn't included in sent data.
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure text is actually selected (highlighted)
2. Try selecting text differently (click and drag)
3. Use the popup method instead of context menu
4. Refresh the page and try again

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Checking Extension Status
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find clicPOST in the list
3. Ensure it's enabled (toggle should be blue)
4. Check for any error messages

#### Viewing Browser Console

2. Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
3. Click the "Console" tab

#### Testing Server Connectivity
You can test your server endpoint manually:
```bash
# Using curl (in terminal/command prompt)
curl -X POST https://your-server.com/api/endpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"test","title":"test"}'
```

## Privacy and Security

### Data Handling
- **No Storage**: clicPOST doesn't store your data locally
- **Direct Transmission**: Data goes directly from your browser to your server

### Security Best Practices
